# Generative AI for Beginners - A Course 

Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 12-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates. Each lesson covers a key aspect of Generative AI principles and application development. Throughout this course, you will be building your own Generative AI startup so you can get an understanding of what it takes to launch your ideas. 

## üå± Getting Started

To get started, [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to find it easier later.

Below are the links to each lesson. Feel free to explore and start at any lesson that interests you the most!
